        <h3>About me</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          I was born and raised in a small town (Zanesville, OH) with a
          close-knit community where I developed a love for the outdoors and
          physical activity. I am now living in Cincinnati, Ohio since becoming
          a full-time student at the University of Cincinnati. Some of my
          hobbies include lifting weights, playing basketball, and most of all
          enjoying quality time with friends and family.
          <br />
          <br />
          I was a very active person from a young age and spent a lot of time
          outside and playing sports. I am still an avid sports fan and I am
          always finding ways to stay in shape. I was lucky to have such a
          supportive family and friends who encouraged my interests and
          passions. I put a lot of effort toward self-improvement, and I am
          always seeking out new challenges and opportunities to grow. With my
          experience in sports and blue-collar work along with my supportive
          family, I know that my strong work ethic and determination will
          continue to drive me to succeed.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since I was young, I have always been inspired to create. I believe
          that technology is a powerful tool that allows us to bring our ideas
          to life and make a real impact on the world. This is what drew me to
          information technology and software development. I have a passion for
          using technology as a tool to solve problems and improve people's
          lives, and I believe that there is infinite potential for growth and
          innovation in this field.
        </p>

        <h3>My coding journey</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          My coding journey started with a passion for design. During my early
          years in high school, I took a graphic design course out of
          curiousity. Adobe Photoshop amazed me with its features and use cases.
          It quicky became a fun hobby that allowed me to express my creativity
          and create cool things. Over time, I became proficient in Photoshop
          and my work. My interest and experience in design, my desire for
          growth and my proficiency with technology had led me to explore
          programming and development.
          <br />
          <br />
          Java was the first language that i wrote <i>"Hello, World!"</i> in. I
          was first introduced to Java and was immediately presented with the
          logic and structure of Object-Oriented-Programming. I spent a long
          time learning the basics of writing clean code and making the most out
          of my simple projects/programs.
          <br />
          <br />
          As I've progressed in my studies, I became much more interested the
          front-end with web development. I started to learn front-end
          languages. I was amazed at how basic HTML and CSS can be used to
          create functional websites. I was determined to master these
          technologies, and I've spent countless hours customizing and
          experimenting with my designs using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
        </p>

        <p>

          the latest technologies and trends in the field so I am continuously
          learning and growing my skills with coursework this semester (spring
          2023).
